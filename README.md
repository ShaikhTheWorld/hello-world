# hello-world

Hey there folks! :D

The name's Sheikh - and where programming is concerned... apart from watching some courses online, and a single competition that I had attended... I'm really new to this thing.

As a person, if I am to be honest with you - I would like to 'Save the World'. 

It's something really personal for me, but a brief explanation of what I mean by this, and how intend to achieve this, is the following:

Save the World = Improve lives of people = Improve quality of thoughts of people = Improve my life = Improve quality of my own thoughts.

That being said, I look forward to learning a whole bunch through my collaborations with all of you - hopefully I shall in turn be of help and value to you as well! :3 

PS. If you'd like to know more about me, and the sort of stuff I have been up to on my quest to 'Save the World', don't forget to check me out on social media down below! <3
